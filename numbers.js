//1. provide the sum of the following variables 
var num10 = 10;
var string8 = '8';
var one = 1;




//2. write a loop that will log only numbers divisible by 3 between 20 - 100
for (var i = 0; i < 100; i =+ 3) {}


//3. find the class average given the following test scores

var scores = [88, 84, 100, 92, 70, 76, 76, 84, 86, 98]; 
scores = 85.4
